# Lesson 2 - Introduction to while loops

## Recap 1: For Loop
**Task: write a separate 'for' loop to print the following
numbers:**
1. from 0 - 20
2. from 1 to 30
3. from 2 to 24 (in even numbers)

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 1: Introduction to while loop
**Task: Using a separate 'while' loop, print each of the
following:**
1. from 0 to 20
2. from 1 to 30
3. from 2 to 24

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: while... break
The **break** keyword will **break** out (exit) the loop.
When a **break** is encountered, the code in the **else** will
not be run.

Using a while loop:
1. print the numbers from 1 to 10
2. if the number is 5, **break** out of the loop

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 3: while... else
The else condition will run when the loop exits normally
i.e. when the while condition is no longer true.

**Task 3a**: Using a while loop
1. print the numbers from 1 to 10
2. once count has reached 10, use the else and print "Count
   has reached 10"

**Task 3b**:
Now, modify your 'while' loop such that:
1. If the number is 5, **break** out of the loop
2. Ensure your code has an else

Observe if the code in the **else** runs.

## Task 4: Ordering Pizzas with while loop
**Task: Using what you have learned above, code a program to
take a customer's order for pizza.
Declare a variable called _topping_.**

Using a while loop:
1. Ask the user to enter a choice of topping
2. For each topping entered, concatenate to the 'topping'
   variable
3. exit the while loop if the user enters "end"
4. On program end, print out the toppings that the customer
   has chosen.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 5: General Knowledge Quiz
**Task: Create a program to quiz users on their general
knowledge**

Using the while loop, ask 3 general knowledge questions
1. Using input ask the question
2. While answer is not correct, repeat the question.
3. Move on to the next question when the answer is correct

Bonus:
1. Add a score system
2. Add an ability for users to skip by saying “skip”
3. Disqualify user when they have tried too many times
