# Lesson 7 - 2 dimensional list

## Recap 1: Student Contact Database
Task: Create a contact database for students
1. Create a list variable called students
2. Create 3 lists called student1, student2, student3
    each student should have the following info:
        1. name
        2. phone number
        3. CCA
3. Add student1, student2, student3 into the students list.
4. Unpack the list and use loop and string concatenation to
   print the details for each student in the following format:

   Name: James
   Phone number: 85726845
   CCA: Hockey

## Task 1: Introduction to List Merging
You are given 2 lists of fruits. Merge them into 1 list and
print the result:

list1 = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
list2 = ["Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]

1. Use the + operator to combine the lists.
2. Print the combined list.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: Ordered List Merging
You are given 2 lists that contain the price of fruits. Now,
merge 2 given lists and ensure the resulting list is sorted.

list1 = [3.20, 2.65, 1.75]
list2 = [6.15, 5.45, 4.20]

1. Merge the lists using the + operator.
2. Use the sorted() function to sort the combined list.
3. Print the sorted list.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 3: Splitting Lists at a Point
You are required to divide a basket of fruits.
Split the given list at the specified index:

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]
index = 3

1. Use slicing to split the list at the provided index.
2. Print the resulting sublists.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 4: Splitting a List in Half
You have been tasked to divide the basket of fruits into
2 equal halves. Given a list of even length, split it
into 2 equal halves.

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]

1. Find the midpoint of the list.
2. Split the list into 2 halves using slicing.
3. Print both halves.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 5: Identifying Common Elements in Lists
You have been given 2 lists of fruits. However, there might be
duplicates. Your job is to identify and print the common fruits
between them.

list1 = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian"]
list2 = ["Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]

1. Create an empty list named 'common'
2. Using 'for' loops, append common elements into 'common'
3. Print the common elements

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 6: Merging Lists Unique Items
You have been given 2 lists of fruits that contains duplicates.
Your task is to merge the 2 lists into a new list that contain
no duplicates.

list1 = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Cherry"]
list2 = ["Cherry", "Durian", "Durian", "Figs"]

1. Create an empty list named 'unique'
2. Using 'for' loops, append unique elements into 'unique'
3. Print the unique elements

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 7: Merging Lists with Conditions
You have been given the index number of 2 groups of students.
However, only students with even index number is allowed
to come into the room. Create a Python script that will
merge the 2 lists, including only the elements that are
even from both.

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]

1. Merge the lists using a list comprehension with a
   condition.
2. Print the new list.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 8: Nested List Splitting
You are given a nested list of 3 groups of students that
are each seated in a pair. However, you want to unpack
the nested lists in order to have a list of all students.

nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]

1. Use a loop or list comprehension to flatten the list.
2. Print the flattened list.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 9: Partitioning a List into Smaller Lists
You have been tasked to divide a class of 9 students
into groups of 3.

Given a list and a size, split the list into multiple
sub-lists where each sub-list is of the given size.

students = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
size = 3

1. Use a loop to create sub-lists of the specified size.
2. Print the sub-lists.
